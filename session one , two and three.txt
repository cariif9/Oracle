THERE TWO TYPES OF USER AND THEY ARE:: NON-TECHNICAL USERS AND TECHNICAL USERS

1::THE TECHNICAL USERS  ARE  DBA OR ORACLE SQL OR PL/SQL DEVELOPER========DBA MEANS DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR 
2::THE NON-TECHNICAL USERS ARE END USERS OR BACK-END EMPLOYEES ==THEY DON'T KNOW  WHAT HAPPENS BEYOND THEM

#THE NON-TECHNICAL USERS MAY BE USE Ui LIKE WEBPAGES INTRACTES WITH  ORACLEDATABASE THE REQUEST WILL BE SENDT TO BACK-END DATABASE

#THE TECHNICAL USERS  MAY BE USING WEBPAGES OR CLIENT TOOLS TO  INTRACTES WITH ORACLE DATABASE 


CLIENT TOSLS ARE DIVED INTO TWO TYPES

{WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF SQL }
==================================
FOUR  PROPERTIES  ARE

1::::: IN SQL PLUS EACH QUERY SHOULD BE TERMINATED WITH THE SEMICOLON== THE END OF QUERY MUST BE A SEMICOLON
2::::: SQL QURRIES  ARE NOT CASE-SENSITIVE = MAY BE UPPER-CASE OR LOWWER-CASE OR MIXED-CASE
3::::: IN SQL PLUS WINDOW YOU CAN EXCUTE AT ATIME ONLY ONE QUERY 
4:::::SQL IS ANSI STANDARD MRANS::SQL IS UNIVERSALAY `ACCEPTED BY ANY RDBM
